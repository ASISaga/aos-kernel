# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agent Operating System (AOS) will be documented in this file.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-22

### Breaking Changes

#### Removed Backward Compatibility Code
- **Removed** `agents/base.py` (v1.x) - Use `agents/base_agent.py`
- **Removed** `agents/leadership.py` (v1.x) - Use `agents/leadership_agent.py`
- **Removed** `services/interfaces.py` (legacy) - Use `services/service_interfaces.py`

#### Updated Exports
- `agents/__init__.py` now exports only v2.0.0 classes
- `services/__init__.py` now exports only canonical service interfaces
- Removed `Agent`, `StatefulAgent` from main exports
- Removed `BaseAgentNew`, `LeadershipAgentNew` aliases (now canonical `BaseAgent`, `LeadershipAgent`)

### Added

#### Agent Skills
- Created `code-refactoring` skill for major version refactoring guidance
- Updated skills catalog with refactoring best practices

### Changed
- All internal imports updated to use v2.0.0 classes
- Simplified module exports for cleaner API
- Updated documentation to reflect v3.0.0 changes

### Migration Guide

External consumers must update imports:

**Before (v1.x/v2.x):**
```python
from AgentOperatingSystem.agents.base import BaseAgent
from AgentOperatingSystem.agents.leadership import LeadershipAgent
# or
from AgentOperatingSystem.agents import BaseAgentNew, LeadershipAgentNew
```

**After (v3.0.0):**
```python
from AgentOperatingSystem.agents import BaseAgent, LeadershipAgent
```
