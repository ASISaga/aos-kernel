# AgentOperatingSystem Implementation

AgentOperatingSystem is built using multiple domain specific, PurposeDrivenAgent(s), operating perpetually, just like daemons of a compute operating system.

---

## Architecture Note: Storage and Environment Managers

The AgentOperatingSystem (AOS) is intentionally domain-agnostic. It does **not** include application-specific storage or environment managers. These responsibilities are delegated to applications built on top of AOS (such as BusinessInfinity), which manage their own configuration, secrets, and persistent data according to their needs.

This separation of concerns ensures AOS remains reusable and flexible for a wide range of domains and applications.

## Architecture Overview

The AgentOperatingSystem (AOS) provides a framework for managing and coordinating multiple AI agents to work together as a cohesive system. It mirrors traditional operating system concepts by implementing:

- **Agent Daemons**: Perpetually running agents that operate continuously in the background
- **Agent Teams**: Coordinated groups of specialized agents working collaboratively
- **Resource Management**: Efficient allocation of computational resources across agents
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Standardized messaging protocols for agent coordination
- **Shared Memory System**: Centralized knowledge store for agent collaboration

## Core Components

### 1. PerpetualAgent Class

The `PerpetualAgent` serves as the foundation for daemon-like agents that operate continuously:

```python
class PerpetualAgent(AssistantAgent):
    def __init__(self, tools, system_message):
        super().__init__(
            name="PerpetualAgent", 
            model_client=self.model_client, 
            tools=tools, 
            system_message=system_message
        )
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Asynchronous Operation**: Utilizes asyncio for non-blocking execution
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Operates indefinitely, responding to triggers and events
- **Tool Integration**: Supports custom tools for specialized functionality
- **Model Client Integration**: Uses OpenAI Chat Completion Client for LLM interactions

**Implementation Features:**
- Automatic error recovery and resilience mechanisms
- Configurable intervals for periodic task execution
- Health monitoring and heartbeat mechanisms
- Resource-efficient operation patterns

### 2. AgentTeam Framework

The `AgentTeam` class orchestrates multiple agents in collaborative workflows:

```python
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMessageTermination

# Create agent team with termination conditions
team = RoundRobinGroupChat(
    [perpetual_agent, coder_agent],
    termination_condition=termination_condition,
)
```

**Team Management Features:**
- **Round-Robin Execution**: Balanced task distribution among team members
- **Termination Conditions**: Configurable stopping criteria for team operations
- **Dynamic Agent Addition**: Runtime modification of team composition
- **Role-Based Coordination**: Agents assigned specific roles within teams

### 3. Integration with PurposeDrivenAgent Framework

The AOS leverages the PurposeDrivenAgent framework for specialized agent capabilities:

**Domain-Specific Agents:**
- **CoderAgent**: Autonomous code development and execution
- **KnowledgeAgent**: Information synthesis and retrieval
- **IntelligenceAgent**: Advanced reasoning and analysis
- **LearningAgent**: Continuous knowledge acquisition

**Purpose-Driven Architecture:**
- Each agent operates with a specific purpose that drives all decisions
- Dynamic domain knowledge generation based on agent purpose
- Continuous opportunity evaluation and action guidance
- Collaborative intelligence through agent networks

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Management

The system uses a centralized configuration approach via `config.py`:

```python
# Azure OpenAI Configuration
azure_openai_model = "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09"
azure_openai_endpoint = ""
azure_openai_key = ""
azure_openai_api_version = "2024-02-01"

# Amazon Bedrock Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"
bedrock_model_id = "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0"
```

## Unified Core Features and Application Guidance

The AgentOperatingSystem (AOS) is now the single source of truth for all core features: agent orchestration, storage, environment, ML pipeline, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and authentication. All applications (including BusinessInfinity) must import these features from AOS. No application-specific or local implementations exist outside AOS.

**How to use core features:**
Import all managers and core features from `RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem`. For example:
```python
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.storage.manager import UnifiedStorageManager
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.environment import UnifiedEnvManager
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.ml_pipeline_ops import MLPipelineManager
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.mcp_servicebus_client import MCPServiceBusClient
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.aos_auth import UnifiedAuthHandler
```

See the docstrings and this documentation for full API details.

**Separation of Concerns:**
- AOS: All agent orchestration, resource management, storage, environment, ML pipeline, MCP, and authentication logic
- Application (e.g., BusinessInfinity): Business logic, user interface, and orchestration of agents via AOS

**Note:** All legacy code and local implementations of these features in applications have been removed. Update your imports and integrations accordingly.
